# Finding your token
Go to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), then open your browser's developer console (Ctrl + Shift + i or F12). Go to the network tab, and find the request that is of type/initiator "document", scoll down to the request headers, and the giant string of numbers and letters after the "session=" bit is your token. DO NOT SHARE THIS WITH OTHERS!!!
